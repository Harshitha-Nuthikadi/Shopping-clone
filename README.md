Tech Stack & Tools
HTML5: Structuring the complete layout.

CSS3: Styling, media queries for responsiveness, hover and transition effects.

No JavaScript frameworks, no backend — purely front‑end focused.

Why This Project Stands Out
Clean and well-organized layout of product sections and navigation.

Excellent demonstration of responsive design and styling techniques.

Great portfolio addition for front‑end developers learning modern CSS.

Future Enhancements (Optional)
Add JavaScript interactivity: shopping cart, search bar, dynamic filters.

Integrate backend/database: product listings via JSON or API.

Enable user accounts or payment simulation integration.

Add accessibility improvements and ARIA tags.
